# McMaster-Designathon-Hyperloop-Interior
Our team of 4 designed a conceptual interior for a "Hyperloop" shuttle that would comfortably seat passengers.

We designed the low-fidelity prototypes with hand-drawings, and implemented the final designs using SolidWorks.

Our design philosophy was to maximize comfort and ameneties, to allow for a luxurious feel for all passengers while riding in the Hyperloop.
